Initial state has been set up and populated with the initial list of conversations
ConversationsContainer wraps ConversationList
* Retrieves conversations from redux state and passes to ConversationList

Up next:
Do the same thing for ConversationDetail
Somehow we want to get a portion of the state tree (messages just for the particular converation)

First pass all messages to the ConversationDetail, then try to only send a subset

--------
Added currentUser, currentConversation, and message to the redux state
Created messages container which pulls data out of state and passes to ConversationDetail

TODO: currentUser and currentConversation are hardcoded. We need to create an action which when dispatch updates currentConversation.
This action should be dispatched when you tap on a conversation in the list of conversations.

--------
Where can we go from here?
* More UI
* Create conversation
* (Networking) File upload
* Send message
* Persist state

1. Create conversation
2. Persist state
