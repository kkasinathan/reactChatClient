Initial state has been set up and populated with the initial list of conversations
ConversationsContainer wraps ConversationList
* Retrieves conversations from redux state and passes to ConversationList

Up next:
Do the same thing for ConversationDetail
Somehow we want to get a portion of the state tree (messages just for the particular converation)

First pass all messages to the ConversationDetail, then try to only send a subset

October 17
--------
Added currentUser, currentConversation, and message to the redux state
Created messages container which pulls data out of state and passes to ConversationDetail

TODO: currentUser and currentConversation are hardcoded. We need to create an action which when dispatch updates currentConversation.
This action should be dispatched when you tap on a conversation in the list of conversations.


October 31
--------
Where can we go from here?
* More UI
* Create conversation
* (Networking) File upload
* Send message
* Persist state

1. Create conversation
2. Persist state

November 21, 2017
* Added immutable
* Added sending messages in an existing conversation

Up next: persistence

November 28, 2017
* Tried to add redux-persist
* Had issues with initialState not matching structure created by persistCombineReducers
* Seems that initial state can't be immutable
* How does redux-persist reconcile when given initialState?
* There's redux-persist-immutable which is from the owner of redux-persist. Still on v4, which has big API changes from v5.

December 5, 2017
* Combine reducers requires top level state to be plain js object
* We want them to be immutable
* How can we use a non-immutable state?
